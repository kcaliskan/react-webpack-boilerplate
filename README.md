# React Webpack Boilerplate

You don't want to use Create React App but also don't want over-engineered boilerplate too? I got you.

React Webpack Boilerplate comes with pre-configured Webpack 4, Babel, ESlint and Prettier.

## How can I start to use it?

You ask good questions. 

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate the project folder on the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` on the command line
4. Good to go!

## Can I use the Webpack live server with this boilerplate?

Yes!

Just run the command: `npm run start`

## I want to deploy my project, how can I get the bundled version?

First, congrats for the production-ready code.

Run the command: `npm run create`.

After that you will see the `index_bundle.js` file under the `public` folder. Basically, drag and drop `public` folder the your ftp. Just kidding..(or not).

## Did you add your ESLint rules or use a pre-config?

I use Airbnb's ESLint config. You can see it's details [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb).

I also added Prettier and configured it to work with ESLint without having a problem.



Keep coding,\
