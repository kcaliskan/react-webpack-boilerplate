# React Webpack Boilerplate

You don't want to use Create React App but also don't want over-engineered boilerplate too? I got you.

React Webpack Boilerplate comes with pre-configured Webpack 4, Babel, ESlint and Prettier.

## How can I start to use it?

You ask good questions. 

1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate the folder on the terminal.
3. Run "npm install" on the command line
4. Good to go!

## Can I use the Webpack live server with this boilerplate?

Yes!

Just run the command: `npm run start`

## I want to deploy my project, how can I get the bundled version?

First, congrats for the production-ready code.

Run the command: `npm run create`.

After that you will see the `index_bundle.js` file under the `public` folder. Basically, drag and drop `public` folder the your ftp. Just kidding..(or not).

# Thank you
Keep coding,
